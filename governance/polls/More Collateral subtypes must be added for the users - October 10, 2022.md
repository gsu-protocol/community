# Poll: More Collateral subtypes must be added for the users - October 30, 2022

The Governance Facilitators have placed a Governance Poll into the voting system on behalf of the GSU Community. This Governance [Poll](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will be active for five days beginning on Saturday, October 30 at 10:00 UTC.

**This is a binary vote.** 
- **You may vote for a single option.**
- **You should vote for the option that you prefer.** 
- **If you would accept any of the options you should vote 'Abstain'.**

## Review

The community can vote in this poll to express support or opposition for the following change to the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM):

* Raise the [ESM threshold](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/shutdown/emergency-shutdown-module) from 75,000 GSUp to 100,000 GSUp.

Please review the discussion [thread](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-request-raise-threshold-for-emergency-shutdown-module/12208) to help inform your position before voting.

Further information about the ESM is available [here](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/emergency-shutdown).

## Outcomes

**If the votes for the 'Yes' option exceed the votes for the 'No' option then the following actions will be taken:**
* This parameter change will take place in a future executive vote as the Protocol Engineering Core Unit's schedule allows. 
* It is expected that this executive vote will take place within 30 days of this poll passing, absent external factors.
* If the executive vote passes, then this change will become active in the GSU Protocol after the [GSM Pause Delay](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/param-gsm-pause-delay) has expired.

**If the votes for the 'No' option equal or exceed the votes for the 'Yes' option then no further action will be taken at this time.**
